I am a PhD student at University of Warwick in the Department of Computer Science, supervised by [Prof. Theodoros Damoulas](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/statistics/staff/academic-research/damoulas/). I am also a member of the [Warwick Machine Learning Group](https://wmlg.io/).

I hold the "Onassis Scholarship for Doctoral Studies" fellowship of the [Onassis Foundation](https://www.onassis.org/) and my research is also supported by the "Turing AI Acceleration Fellowship" of the [Alan Turing Institute](https://www.turing.ac.uk/) on Machine Learning Foundations of Digital Twins.

Prior to my PhD, I completed the MSc in Machine Learning at UCL (2020) with Distinction and the 4-year BSc in Mathematics at the National and Kapodistrian University of Athens (2019) with First-Class Honours.

More information about my background can be found on my [CV](https://yfelekis.github.io/files/CV_Y_FELEKIS_page.pdf).

Research Interests
======
My research interests lie in the intersection of Machine Learning and Causality. Specifically, my  focus is on Causal Inference applications on Abstraction Theory and the theoretical foundations of causally-inspired Digital Twins and how the later ones could be applied in the fields of social sciences and decision making theory.
I also have a strong personal interest in the philosophical topic of causation in natural sciences.
