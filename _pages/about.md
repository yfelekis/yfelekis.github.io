I am a PhD student at the University of Warwick in the Department of Computer Science and member of the [Warwick Machine Learning Group](https://wmlg.io/), supervised by [Prof. Theodoros Damoulas](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/statistics/staff/academic-research/damoulas/).

I hold the "Onassis Scholarship for Doctoral Studies" fellowship of the [Onassis Foundation](https://www.onassis.org/) and my research is also supported by the [UKRI Turing AI Acceleration Fellowship](https://www.ukri.org/news/new-turing-ai-fellows-to-deliver-world-class-ai-research/) on Machine Learning Foundations of Digital Twins, awarded to Prof. Theodoros Damoulas.

Prior to my PhD, I completed the MSc in Machine Learning at UCL with Distinction where I was fortunate to work with [Prof. Theodoros Damoulas](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/statistics/staff/academic-research/damoulas/) and [Prof. Brooks Paige](https://tbrx.github.io/) and the 4-year BSc in Mathematics at the National and Kapodistrian University of Athens with First-Class Honours.

For a more detailed overview of my academic and professional background, please refer to my [CV](https://yfelekis.github.io/files/CV_Y_FELEKIS_page.pdf) *(last updated: Sep. 2025)*.

Stay tuned for my upcoming [talks](https://yfelekis.github.io/talks/)!

Research Interests
======
My research lies at the intersection of Causality and Probabilistic Machine Learning, with a focus on Causal Representation Learning in multi-scale systems. I study foundational questions in this area through the framework of *Causal Abstraction*, which formalizes how causal models describing the same system at different levels of granularity can be related in a consistent and principled way. In particular, I have been developing methodologies that make it possible to learn such abstractions directly from data using advanced statistical learning techniques. This work contributes to the theoretical foundations of causally-inspired Digital Twins and their potential applications in the social sciences and decision-making theory. I also have a personal interest in the philosophy of causation and the emergence of structure in natural systems.
